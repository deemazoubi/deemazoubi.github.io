        <p class="text">Bubbles loved playing with his friends near the coral reef. They would chase each other around the colorful corals, hiding between sea anemones and darting through underwater caves. But deep inside, Bubbles was curious about the world beyond the reef. He often wondered what lay above the surface of the water.</p>

    <div id="second-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">Bubbles was fascinated by their stories. They spoke of a bright blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and something called the sun that warmed the water. He wanted to see it for himself. But then he remembered what some fish said about dangers near the surface big boats, fishing nets, and creatures that could swallow him whole.</p>

    <img src="img/bubbles4.png" class="story-image">
    
    <div id="third-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">Despite his fears, Bubbles could not stop thinking about the sky. He decided he had to be brave. Taking a deep breath, he started swimming up, higher than he had ever gone before. The water around him changed, becoming lighter as he neared the surface.</p>

    <div id="fourth-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">"Be careful, little one," said the turtle with a slow, gentle voice. "The world above is beautiful, but it has dangers too. If you go too close to boats, you might get caught in a net. Always be watchful and trust your instincts." Bubbles thanked the turtle and promised to be careful.</p>

    <div id="fifth-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">Finally, Bubbles reached the surface. He peeked his head out of the water, and his eyes widened in amazement. The sky was endless and blue, stretching as far as he could see. Soft clouds floated above, and the suns golden rays warmed his scales. It was more beautiful than he had imagined.</p>

    <div id="sixth-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">But then, a dark shadow loomed over him. A fishing boat was nearby, and a large net was being lowered into the water. Bubbles heart pounded. He had been so amazed by the sky that he forgot to be careful!</p>

    <div id="seventh-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">The net was getting closer! Bubbles panicked. He had to escape! He darted downward, swimming as fast as he could, twisting and turning through the water. The net brushed past his tail, but he managed to slip away just in time.</p>

    <div id="eighth-text" class="text-section">
        <p class="text">Bubbles did not stop swimming until he was back in the safety of the reef. He gasped for breath, his heart still racing. His friends surrounded him, eager to hear what had happened. He told them about the sky, the sun, and the clouds but also about the danger of the net.</p>

        <p class="text">Bubbles admitted that he had been so curious that he forgot to be careful. He learned something important: it is good to explore and see new things, but one must always be aware of the risks and listen to those who have experience.</p>

        <p class="text">From that day on, Bubbles was known as the little brave fish who saw the sky. He still loved adventures, but he always remembered to be cautious and listen to wise advice. And whenever he looked up at the surface of the water, he smiled, knowing that he had seen the great, endless sky.</p>
